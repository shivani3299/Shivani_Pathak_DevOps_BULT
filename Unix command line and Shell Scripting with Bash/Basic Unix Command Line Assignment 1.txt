Objective:- Assignments will help trainees to understand the basics of unix command and how to explore and use it.

DO NOT copy paste commands from internet, you can take help of the Unix in-built command manual.

Be Honest to yourself!

Important command and option to learn unix commands:-
man Command
Example:-
man ls

--help Option
Example:-
ls --help

NOTE:- Always use "man" command before using any unix commands and read about it and its options and how to use it.

Assignments:-

NOTE:- TAB key is your friend when it comes to command completion and having long file and directory names autocompleted at the bash prompt for you. 
JUST BE LAZY AND USE TAB KEY FOR AUTO COMPLETION ;-)

What are the different types of shell and where are they used and how do we use them?
=>Bourne-shell(sh)==It is also used as the default shell for all Solaris system administration scripts, 

GNU bourne-Again shell(bash)==It incorporates useful features from different types of shells in Linux such as Korn shell and C shell,

cshell==It was developed to include useful programming features like in-built support for arithmetic operations and a syntax similar 
to the C programming language, 

korn shell==function manipulation similar to the C programming language. It also supports scripts which were written for the C shell. 
Further, it is faster than most different types of shells in Linux, including the C shell., 

z shell==The Z Shell or zsh is a sh shell extension with tons of improvements for customization.


What is the difference between login shell and non-login shell?
=>bash status indicates login or non-login state. For -bash(login shell) and bash(non-login shell).


How do we start login shell and non-login shell?
=>for shell bash -l or sh -l
for root sudo -i

What happens when you start a login shell (which files are read and used and Why)?
=>When Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option,
 it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile , if that file exists.
 After reading that file, it looks for ~/.

What happens when you start a non-login shell (Which files are read and used and Why)?
=>When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, Bash reads and executes commands from ~/. .
 The --rcfile file option will force Bash to read and execute commands from file instead of ~/. bashrc 

What are Shell Configuration Files, why do we need it?
=>This file contains individual specific configurations. This file is read at login and also each time a new Bash shell is started. 
This file is used to customize key bindings/key strokes.


Explain the Order of file usage from the system/user's home directory when user logs in to the System.
=>


What are Shell Variables, list major shell variables and what do they represent?
=> A shell variable is a special variable that is set by the shell and is required by the shell in order to function correctly.
  $0==The filename of the current script.
  $#==The number of arguments supplied to a script.
  $*==All the arguments are double quoted. If a script receives two arguments, $* is equivalent to $1 $2.
  $@==All the arguments are individually double quoted. If a script receives two arguments, $@ is equivalent to $1 $2.
  $?==The exit status of the last command executed.
  $$==The process number of the current shell. For shell scripts, this is the process ID under which they are executing.
  $!==The process number of the last background command.


How we see all our env variables?
=>get-childitem env:*


How we see all env variables in alphabical order?
=>get-childitem env:* | sort-object Key | more


What Format does the env var and its values are stored?
=>You can set your own persistent environment variables in your shell configuration file, 
  the most common of which is ~/. bashrc.


How do you create your own varible?
=>sudo -H gedit /etc/environment will open a file where we can user VARNAME="variable"


How do you start a new bash shell?
=>By typing gnome-terminal in current working terminal


Difference between Local/Shell variables to Global Variable
=>The local variable is visible in the shell, where it was defined only.
  The global variable is visible for any running process that runs from the shell.


Making a variable accessible from other the shell in the system.
=>To make a variable available to every new process, then you can put it in /etc/environment (requires root privileges) or ~/. profile. 
  Once you put it in these variables, you typically have to re-login.


Show the real life use case of exporting a variable
=>Export is a built-in command of the Bash shell. It is used to mark variables and functions to be passed to child processes.
  Basically, a variable will be included in child process environments without affecting other environments.
  

Convert the above script file into a command, The file should run with "myappp" instead of "myapp.sh"

What is Globbing? Explain in depth with examples?

List all entries with extension ".sh"
=>ls *.sh


List all entries with numbers in it.
=>grep -x -E '[0-9]+'


List all entries that starts with a character and ends with a number
=>grep -o '^\[.*apal$' file.txt


List all entries that name length more than 5 characters
=>find /tmp -type f -print| awk -F/ ' length($NF)  == 5 '


What is Quoting? and Why do we need it?
=>Shell Script and causes termination of a word unless quoted.
  For example, ? matches with a single character while listing files in a directory and an * matches more than one character.

Write few(minimum 3) unique examples that shows, how a particular problem is solved using Quoting.
=> This are some examples used in Quoting
* ? [ ] ' " \ $ ; & ( ) | ^ < > new-line space tab
Exples that show Quoting
echo Hello; Word
echo "I have \$VAlue_of variable"
echo "Current Date: $DATE"


How do you find a particular files/directories based on a particular search criteria?
-> locate, find and whereis


Write major difference between locate, find and whereis?
=>The basic difference that I observed is that locate 
  locates all the related file names in the entire filesystem, whereas whereis and which 
  commands only give the location (system/local address of file) of installed application.

How Globbing is different from locate, find and whereis?
=>Big difference is that find searches real files recursively down a given directory, 
  while locate searches a database without requiring specific directory.


Explain the Linux File System.
=>Linux file system is generally a built-in layer of a Linux operating system used to handle the 
  data management of the storage. It helps to arrange the file on the disk storage. 
  It manages the file name, file size, creation date, and much more information about a file.

Explain absolute and Relative Paths
=> An absolute path is a complete path from start of actual file system from / directory. 
  Relative path. Relative path is defined as the path related to the present working directly(pwd)

What are the different ways of creating a File in linux System? Write an example of each and the difference between them.
=> touch 1.txt
  cat > 1.txt
  >1.txt
  echo "hwjhwjd" > 1.txt
  printf ‘First line of text\n’ test5.txt

In how many ways we can delete the files from linux system? write an example of each and teh difference between them.
=>rm filename
rm filename_1 filename_2 filename_3
rm *.bmp
cd /tmp


Archiving files using linux command, write a command to archive set of files from linux commands.
=>$ ls ostechnix/
file.odt image.png song.mp3
$ tar cf ostechnix.tar ostechnix/

Extract the archived files from the above step.
=>$ tar xf ostechnix.tar
