We are going to use nested functions to simulate the
kind of abstraction you find in many object oriented 
languages. Create the following structures in your 
script:

a function that defines two local variables to hole the 
number of arms and legs that a human being has.
nested functions, one for each a male and female, 
that contain the appropriate number of beards that 
each gender has.
capture the gender as a command line parameter.
test the command line parameter and call the 
appropriate functions in order to display the 
characteristics of the indicated gender.

#!/bin/bash

function local
{
	local var=$1
	local var1=$1
	read -p "How many legs does human have" var
	read -p "How many arms does human have" var1
	echo "$var $var1"
 	
	read -p "Enter gender(male or female)" gen
	case $gen in
	male)
		echo "Male have beard";;
	female)
		echo "Female doesn't have beard";;
	*)
		echo "Error";;
	esac
}
