Write a script that takes a single command line 
parameter intended to be the user's first name. 
Prompt the user for their age and read that into a 
variable. Using the appropriate method to make that 
command line parameter visible to a function, pass the 
age captured to the function and display a message to 
the user addressing them by name and confirming their 
age, add a calculation of their age in number of days.

#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter your name." name
read -p "Enter your birth year." year
read -p "Enter your birht month." month

yearnow=$(date '+%Y')
monthnow=$(date '+%m')

agey=$(($yearnow-$year))
agem=$(($monthnow-$month))

if [ $agem -lt 0 ] ; then
   agem=$(($monthnow-$month+12))
else
   agem=$(($monthnow-$month))
fi
echo "Your name is: $name and ageis : $agey years and $agem months old!"
