Develop a script that creates, sets and displays two variables to the terminal when run. 
Within this script, add comments to explain what the script is doing, what each variable is and, 

using inline comments, what each command is doing.

#!/bin/bash

#simple note taking script

#get date
date=$(date)

#get topic of note
topic=$1

#user input of note will be displayed
read -p "Your note:" note

echo date:$note >> ~/${topic}notes.txt
echo Note "$note" saved
