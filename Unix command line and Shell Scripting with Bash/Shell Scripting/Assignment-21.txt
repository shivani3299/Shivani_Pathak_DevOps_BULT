Create a simple script containing a single function. 
This function should display a message to clearly 
indicate it was generated when the function was run. 
Then, display another message outside the function 
clearly indicating it was generated outside of it.

#!/bin/bash

echo "Printed message outside the function"
function print_msg 
{
      echo "Printed message inside the function"
}
print_msg
