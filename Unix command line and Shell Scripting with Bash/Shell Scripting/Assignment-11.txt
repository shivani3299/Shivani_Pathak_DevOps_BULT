Create a script that interacts with the user. 
Prompt them to guess a secret number between 1 and 5. 
Read the guess from the terminal and assign it to a 
variable. Using the 'if' statement from the course, 
test that value to determine if they guessed the right 
number (you choose the correct value). 
If they do, display a success message, otherwise do 
nothing. 
#!/bin/bash

echo ""Choose Number Between 1 to 5"

read no 
test=4

if [[$test==$no]]; then
	echo "Guessed right"
else
	echo "Guessed wrong"
fi
