Create a script that interacts with the user. You will want to prompt the user to enter the following information (which you will capture and place into the following variables):

FIRSTNAME
LASTNAME
USERAGE

Greet the user with their name and current age displayed and then calculate and display their age in 10 years.

#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, USER_AGE"
read first_name last_name user_age

echo "Hello, $first_name"

echo "User age after 10 years will be= $(($user_age+10))"
