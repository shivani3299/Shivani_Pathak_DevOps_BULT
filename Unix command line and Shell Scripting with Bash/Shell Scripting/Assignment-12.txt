Write a script that will prompt the user to enter 
a number between 1 and 3. 
Capture that number in a variable and then test that 
variable. 
Be sure to display the variable and it's value as 
appropriate within an if/then/else statement where the 
final statement will display if they did not enter a
number between 1 and 3 telling them they failed to 
follow instructions. Redirect errors from each of the 
tests to /dev/null (to prevent script errors from 
showing if text is entered for example).

#!/bin/bash

echo "Choose Number Between 1 to 3"

read no 

if [[$no>=1&&$no<=3]]; then
	echo "Number between 1 to 3"
else
	echo "Number greater than 3"
