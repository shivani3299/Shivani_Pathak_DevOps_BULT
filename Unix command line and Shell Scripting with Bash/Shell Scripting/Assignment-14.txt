Develop a simple three item menu to display on the 
terminal. Your script, upon display of the menu, 
should prompt the user to choose one of the three 
available options. Using the 'case' statement from the 
course, display three unique messages depending on 
which number they chose, with a catch all message 
letting them know if they went outside the bounds of 
instructions.

#!/bin/bash

echo "Choose animal from given:"
echo "Cat, Dog, cow"

case $1 in
	cat)
	   echo "meow";;
	dog)
	   echo "woof";;
	cow)
	   echo "mooo";;
	*)
	   echo "undefined"
