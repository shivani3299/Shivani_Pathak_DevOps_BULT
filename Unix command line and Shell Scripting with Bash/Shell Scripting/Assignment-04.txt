Create a simple script that does the following:

Echo a full sentence to the terminal
Echo a different full sentence, but redirect it to /dev/null

Run and display the results and make sure the statements appear where intended.

#!/bin/bash

echo "i have created my first senetence"
echo "Second sentence is used to redirect it to /dev/null" >> ~/dev/null
