Create a script that, when run, 
will accept two command line values as arguments. 
These arguments should be a username and password and 
assigned to two variables in the script named 
appropriately.
Finally, echo those values out to the terminal when run 
to indicate they were read and assigned as expected.

#!/bin/bash

exho "Enter USERNAME and PASSWORD"

read u_name pass

var=$u_name
var1=$pass

echo "$var1 $var2"
