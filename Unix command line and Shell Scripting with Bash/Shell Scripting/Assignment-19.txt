We need to create a menu for our users. 
Display a menu containing three choices AND a choice to
allow them to exit. Display that menu and prompt for a 
choice. Upon choosing the value, it should simply clear
the screen and redisplay the menu (loop until the exit 
choice is given).

HOWEVER, we need to be sure that the end user cannot 
use CTL-C, CTL-Z or a KILL command to terminate the 
application. Add a 'trap' in the script to capture those
attempts and provide instructions on how to exit the 
script using the menu choice instead.

#!/bin/bash

read -p "enter Your Choice (Option1,option2,option3)" opt

do
	case $op in
		option1)
			echo "Your choice is 1";;
		option2)
			echo "Your choice is 2";;
		option3)
			echo "Your choice is 3";;
		*)
			trap no_ctrlc SIGINT
			while true
			do
				echo sleeping
				sleep 10
			done
		echo "ERROR $REPLY"
	esac
done
