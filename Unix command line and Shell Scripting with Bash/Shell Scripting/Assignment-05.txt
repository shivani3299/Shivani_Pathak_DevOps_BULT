Write a script that runs three commands:

Evaluate an arithmetic expression
Attempt to remove a file that does not exist in the current directory
Evaluate another arithmetic expression


Immediately after each command, echo the exit status of that command to the terminal using the appropriate variable to show success and failure exit codes.

#!/bin/bash

declare -i A=20-5
declare -i B=20*5
#displaying first echo
echo $A

#remove file which doesn't exist
rm t1

#displaying 3rd command
echo $B
